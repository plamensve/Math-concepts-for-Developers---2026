    "### Problem 1. Markdown and elements of LaTeX\n",
    "We write text and math using `Markdown` cells (like the one you're currently reading). Find any reference on what the Markdown syntax can do, for example [this one](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-studio-local/1.2.3?topic=notebooks-markdown-jupyter-cheatsheet). Get acquainted with it and prepare to write some text and code for this, and all other exercises. \n",

    "Math can be a bit more complicated. Jupyter uses a subset of `LaTeX` (which is, in fact, called `MathJax`). It supports most mathematical notation you'll ever want or need. Find a reference for that as well, like [this one](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/), or [this one - Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/symbol-table/fhqmttqvrnhk). I usually have a table of symbols open when I write math, in order to find what I need quickly.\n",

Note how the symbols are written, the width of spaces (it does matter!), and style (e.g., whether some text is _italic_ or not). When giving your explanations, try to show what the letters mean, what the symbols do, etc. Some formulas are much harder to explain, so don't worry about it too much. You **do not** need to explain everything. However, you **do need** to be able to write every formula.\n",

    "### Problem 3. Plotting lines\n",
    "Let's go back to our linear equations. There are many ways to define what \"linear\" means, but they all boil down to the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation $ax + b = 0$ is called *linear* because the _function_ $f(x) = ax+b$ is a straight line. Let's see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that there are several ways to know what one particular function means. One of them is to just write the expression for it, as we did above. Another way is to **plot** it. This is one of the most exciting parts of maths and science - when we have to fiddle around with beautiful plots (although not so beautiful in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we plot functions in general? We know that functions take many (possibly infinitely many) inputs. We can't draw all of them. We could, however, evaluate the function at some points and connect them with tiny straight lines. If the points are too many, we won't notice - the plot will look smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a function, e.g. $y = 2x + 3$ and plot it. For this, we're going to use `numpy` arrays. You can look up more information about what they are and how they work. We'll be dealing with many of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's import `numpy`. Since the name is a bit long, a common convention is to give it an **alias**:\n",

    "\n",
    "Import that at the top cell and don't forget to re-run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's create a range of values, e.g., $[-3, 5]$. There are two ways to do this. `np.arange(start, stop, step)` will give us evenly spaced numbers with a given step, while `np.linspace(start, stop, num)` will give us `num` samples. You see, one uses a fixed step, the other uses a number of points to return. When plotting functions, we usually use the latter. Let's generate, say, 1000 points (we know a straight line only needs two but we're generalizing the concept of plotting here :)).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = np.linspace(-3, 5, 1000)\n",

    "y = 2 * x + 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can print the values if we like but we're more interested in plotting them. To do this, first let's import a plotting library. `matplotlib` is the most commnly used one and we usually give it an alias as well.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's plot the values. To do this, we just call the `plot()` function. Notice that the top-most part of this notebook contains a \"magic string\": `%matplotlib inline`. This hints Jupyter to display all plots inside the notebook. However, it's a good practice to call `show()` after our plot is ready.\n",
